# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on personal and travel information such as age, gender, and passenger class.

## Dataset Source

Dataset: Titanic Dataset
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic. Important features include:

* **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
* **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
* **Age**: Age in years
* **Survived**: Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

The dataset is in CSV format and is suitable for a supervised machine learning task.

## Machine Learning Problem

* **Task Type**: Classification
* **Target Variable**: Survived

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their demographic and travel information.
